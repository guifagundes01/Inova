            <h2>Carbon Credit and Toucan Protocol</h2>
            <h4>From the Series of Sector analysis and blockchain applied</h4>
            <h4>Carbon Market — secular growth tendencies and so much ground for technology</h4>
            <p>
                Environmental issues are a growing concern by companies, because of real problems, such as global warming and other climate changes, 
                and social-political pressure in order for change. Amidst this context, a brand new market urged in the late 90s/early 20s: the carbon market.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                First of all, it is divided in carbon credit, which has the government as the company as the two parties; and carbon offset, which has companies in both side of transactions.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Carbon credits are issued by the government and represent the right to emit CO2 in the atmosphere. 
                For example, each credit that a given company has might represent the right to emit 1 ton of carbon in that year. 
                That issues of credit are based on a system called cap-and-trade, in which public controllers gradually decrease, from years to years, the limit of carbon emission (so called “cap”), 
                and the companies might buy extra credit from the government in order to exceed such limit. There might also happen commerce between companies that emit more carbon than the cap (and want to buy credits) and companies that emit less (and want to sell credits). 
                Notice that credit market is mandated, because it comes from a government imposition.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Offset, on the other hand, is a completely voluntary market that is generally related to environmentally conscious companies. For example, companies that eventually manage to take carbon out of the atmosphere, 
                by planting trees, for example, might sell offsets. Companies that intend to keep a green appearance might buy such assets.

<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Where does blockchain come in? The creators of Toucan Protocol say that this market needs to be public and that trusting in a central organization for emitting carbon offsets is dangerous. In fact, the high standard carbon offsetting may be summarized to two organizations: Verified Carbon Standard (Verra) and Golden Standard (GS). Supporters of decentralization in the sector accuse the risk of greenwashing when trusting in such institutions.<br>
            </p>
            <h4>How does Toucan Protocol work?</h4>
            <p>At first, a new NFT in Polygon network is created. This is the so called BatchNFT; then, one must retire the carbon credit that is going to be transformed into a token, meaning it will no longer be tradeable or appliable in “real” world. Then, the BatchNFT is connected to a unique serial number provided by Verra in the moment of retirement, leading to the final step, which is validation. This process of “transforming” a carbon credit into an NFT is called carbon bridge.<br></p>
            <p>An important part of the protocol is that the user might split each credit into 20 tokens, which are called TCO2. Each TCO2 carries metadata from the NFT, so every transaction in which it has been used can be tracked. Due to this, it is not a fungible token, meaning different tokens have different demands and, thus, different prices.<br></p>
            <p>In order to control that, Toucan Protocol regroups the tokens into more liquid carbon indexes, in a pool of liquidity called Carbon Pool.<br></p>
            <p>In synthesis, Toucan protocol intends to provide more transparency and liquidity in carbon market. We are not sure at all whether the protocol works or if it eases greenwashing, but the fact is that this sector is still very insipient yet has an enormous potential of growth that must be watched closely.<br>
