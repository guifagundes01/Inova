            <h2>Liquidation Cascades</h2>
            <h4>Understanding financial leverage and macroeconomics in order to preview cryptocurrency pricing.</h4>
            <p>
                First of all, let’s understand briefly what it means to have a leveraged position. To say that a position is leveraged means saying that the trader has borrowed money. 
                The ratio of the trader’s equity and the total amount invested is called financial leveraging. At the end of a period, the trader pays the broker the commission, pays the loan to the lender and luckily has their profit. 
                However, if the asset that was bought cheapens, the trader obviously loses money. 
                There is a limit for this decrease of the asset, settled by the lender/broker, meaning there is a maintenance margin requirement. 
                If the percentage of equity falls below this rate, the trader receives a margin call.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we define liquidation, which is a forceful closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange, generally motivated because the trader cannot maintain that certain margin. The bear market we live today was relevantly affected by liquidations, as explained as follows: when Stake Ether, for example, is being traded, and Stake Ether’s price drops (influenced by CPI highs, for example), if this drop is large enough, some positions will be liquidated, meaning that exchanges are going to sell stEther. But that makes stEther’s price drop even more, which affects other positions, and so on. To this subsequent movement we give the name liquidation cascade.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                But let’s move slower. Why does CPI affect stEth price? In a simple explanation, when there is inflation, the government tends to settle interest rates higher, discouraging companies to borrow money. Thus, less money is spent and the supply of money lowers, which stabilizes money’s value.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                High interest rates also stabilize market’s appetite for risk, because bonds keep having very low risk, but now they generate high returns. And that is where cryptocurrencies fall have its first impulse.

            </p>
            <p>
                An important information is knowing the most frequent margin calls in debt contracts around the market. If stEth is dropping, for example, this information might show us in which price the currency will fall even more, in order to assuming a short position.<br>
