                <h2>Ethereum 2.0, Stake Ethereum and Lido Exchange</h2>
                <h4>Understanding the effects of liquidity and Ethereum transition.</h4>
                <p>
                    Ethereum is under an important transition that marks crypto history. 
                    It is no longer going to work under Proof of Work system, moving to Proof of Stake.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Giving a very quick explanation, PoS does not require mining neither absurd computacional work;
                    in this system, the way of creating new blocks in the blockchain is based on participation (=staking, which means holding certain amount of the asset), 
                    and the reward for the launchers of a new block is part of the transaction.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before Ethereum 2.0 is launched, a series of tests are being conducted. For being able to make the Ethereum stake, that is, having the chance of being chosen as a validator, it is necessary to have 32 Ethereums, which definetely is not an amount held by many people. However, there is a platform called Lido Finance that allows anyone to stake in exchange of stake Ethereum, a synthetic asset that is correlated to the number of Ethereums in proof of stake. The relation between the two currency is: for each Ethereum put in staking in Beacon Chain, one of the test platforms used, one stEth is produced.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    But one can find a clear assymetry here. If it weren’t for Lido, StEth and Eth prices should be pretty much the same. Nevertheless, the exchange puts more stEths in the market everytime Eth is taken off, which leads to an oversupply of Stake Ethereum. This has caused StEth to reach only 90% of Eth’s price.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                   There are ways of converting stEth to Eth, but the liquidity pools behind them do not have balanced reserves of the currencies, leading to a crisis of liquidity.<br>
